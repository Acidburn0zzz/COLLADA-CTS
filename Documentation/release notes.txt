CTF_v1.3 (July 28, 2006):
    - fixed some incorrect absolute texture paths to relative paths in the data
      sets
    - added the spline_NURBS_text data set and removed the obsolete spline
      data sets
    - added a Catapult data set
    - added skin_position_animation data set
    - added FXComposer data sets
    - added common_rigid_body data set
    - added moving_concave data set
    - added the collada version of the ragdoll scene and removed the maya 
      version
    - updated the convex_nonconvex data set
    - updated all data sets to use convex_mesh when appropriate
    - updated near/far planes in simple_002_Spotlight_Dropoff_03 to show 
      something in the scene
    - fixed empty bindings in some FX files
    - added missing testCamera from some data sets
    - added remaining missing blessed images
    - corrected all the data sets that do not validate
    - updated to official COLLADA 1.4.1 schema, with the import tag deleted

    - implemented a crude way of allowing multiple data set directories. This 
      can be done by using the list DATA_SET_DIRS in Core/Common/FConstants.py
    - added a fix to file silently when trying to copy a file during export to
      HTML to a path that is too long
    - updated the default settings for the viewer to use testCamera and
      transparent background

CTF_v1.2 (July 2, 2006):
    - added the remaining data sets as defined by Collada testing framework
      proposal
    - added LondonHouse data set donated by SCEA
    - added using a regular expression to store the test scenes that has been 
      deleted so that the CTF does not detect those as new test scenes each 
      time a test procedure is loaded; the GUI has been updated so it can edit
      this new regular expression as well
    - added GetOperationsList in the Fapplication which can be overriden if
      an application specific script does not implement all operations (e.g
      Feeling Viewer)
    - added a check to see if there is a file where the config.txt says a DCC
      is located before attempting to run
    - added a confirmation before deleting a regular expression
    - added a viewer for blessed images/animations which includes a means to
      unbless them (note: the CTF does not have permission to delete some svn
      files, so the user might have to delete the directory if it is under svn)
    - added exporting the initial data set which exporting to HTML
    
    - fixed test procedures being corrupted after some operation stopped the
      CTF from completing its run (e.g. killing the CTF process)
    - fixed crash when attempting to use blank values for settings or values
      that don't cast properly (e.g. not a number for start frame); 
      these values now default to the value given when ::new:: is selected
    - fixed crash due to recursion with over 1000 data sets in a directory
    - fixed possible problems with regular expressions when "special" 
      characters are in the file paths (e.g. "^", "$", ".", etc have special 
      meanings for regular expressions)
    - fixed crashes with really long regular expressions (e.g. greater than
      100,000 characters) by now limiting regular expressions to be no more
      than 30,000 characters but there can be more than one regular expression
      per unique serious of settings; updated the GUI to be able to edit all
      of them and are known as "pages" of a regular expresions
    - fixed crash when attempting to validate Feeling Viewer export data,
      which is nothing
    - fixed a crash with select multiple tests and then show previous
    - fixed outdated comments in FUtils about the GetRelativePath function
    - fixed some typos and updated some message dialogs to be more explanatory

CTF_v1.1b (June 15, 2006):
    - added many data sets
    - added support for exporting to csv donated by Paul McCluskey of SCEA
      along with some cleanup
    - added check to see if feeling viewer CLI exists before trying to run it
    - added a .NET program that can kill a process by name which is used to 
      kill Max and Windows error reporting windows: GUI and command line
    
    - fixed several test cases that did not have testCamera in the scene, or
      had bad data
    - fixed a few blessed images that didn't deserve to be blessed
    - fixed a possible crash because a command that didn't have "\\" as path 
      delimiter
    - fixed minor crash when select "Diff Image" with a non-image file (e.g. 
      maya file)
