Each test case requires a unique ID. When adding a new test to the suite, the test ID must be incremented by one. The test ID is maintained in the COLLADA file's document level <title> element. 


A test case ID is assigned manually as follows:

(1) Read the current test ID listed below in this document
(2) Increment the current test ID by one in this document
(3) Add the test ID to the COLLADA test file's document level <title> element



CURRENT TEST ID: 0701
