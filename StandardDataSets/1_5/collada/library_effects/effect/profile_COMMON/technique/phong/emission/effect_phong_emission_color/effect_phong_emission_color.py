# This sample judging object does the following:
#
# JudgeBaseline: just verifies that the standard steps did not crash.
# JudgeSuperior: also verifies that the validation steps are not in error.
# JudgeExemplary: same as intermediate badge.

# We import an assistant script that includes the common verifications
# methods. The assistant buffers its checks, so that running them again
# does not incurs an unnecessary performance hint.
